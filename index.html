			 <p>A little over a year ago Jenni and I made this wall mounted cookware hanging rack.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2022/29b5bd2792.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2022/29b5bd2792.jpg" alt="Boards mounted on a wall horizontally, with hardware mounted to the boards and pans and decorative items hanging off the hardware."></a></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been wanting a place to put our pans for a while It&rsquo;s tedious to manage them in a drawer or cabinet, if you can even fit them in there. Often some would just stay on the stove and need to be moved out of the way when cooking. Whenever I would see pans hanging, in person or in a photo, it seemed like the best solution. We had space on only one wall in the kitchen, so that decision was easy.</p>
<p>Pans can be heavy and our walls are lathe and plaster, so mounting just about anywhere was out of the question. And so the construction method was narrowed down to boards mounted to studs, with hardware to hang the pans.</p>
<p>We went to the <a href="https://www.woodcrafters.us">amazing local woodworking store</a> where they have finished dimensional lumber and narrowed down our choice based primarily on cost. We wanted a dark color, and I already had dark walnut stain from the <a href="https://samgrover.com/2019/05/25/mail-and-keys.html">mail and keys organizer</a> I made a while back.</p>
<p>Back home, I cut the boards to length. We wanted a tight fit and the two ends, door frame and wall, weren&rsquo;t super plumb so there were a lot of measurements and dry fitting before we had a set of boards that were just right. It was time to apply the stain and let it rest.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2022/5efd3a72bb.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2022/5efd3a72bb.jpg" alt="A triptych of ca can of dark walnut stain, lumber stacked in a store showing a price of $4.29 per linear foot, and Jenni applying the stain to the boards while wearing a respirator."></a></p>
<p>After that it was a straightforward process of screwing in the boards to the studs while using a couple of small blocks to space them evenly.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2022/04343ec9ad.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2022/04343ec9ad.jpg" alt="A triptych showing progression of boards being arranged and mounted on to the wall, and with hardware attached."></a></p>
<p>Once that was done, we installed a couple of IKEA rails that we had and the rack was ready to use. In the days that followed we sourced some nice hooks and Jenni put up a couple of planters and some homegrown produce.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2022/84b2a87972.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2022/84b2a87972.jpg" alt="A diptych showing details of various things hanging off the rack, a planter, dry red chillis, a bunch of garlic pigtailed together and a small plant watering can."></a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been over a year and this has totally been worth it. I highly recommend utilizing vertical space in the kitchen where you can.</p>
<p>P.S. This blog post should&rsquo;ve been written about a year ago. Anyway, it&rsquo;s been written now.</p>

<p>As I was taking these photos I was thinking how I prefer the 2x for compositions when it comes to zoom. 3x is handy but I have so many years of composing in ~50mm (2x on iPhone). Alas, iPhone 13 Pro can only do 2x with a crop on 1x image. Here I thought the tradeoff was worth it.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://samgrover.com/2022/05/06/sneak-peek-at.html">Sneak peek at a new feature coming soon to Mimi Uploader</a></h1>

			 <p>Recent Uploads currently shows the uploads you make from Mimi Uploader. After the next update it will also show uploads made to your Micro.blog account from anywhere else 🎉</p>
<p>Mimi is primarily a batch uploader and that is my favorite way of using it. I like to make blog posts that have a set of photos, and making that process smoother was the motivation to create Mimi in the first place. As such, each batch of photos shows up in Recent Uploads as a set.</p>
<p>The other uploads to a Micro.blog account are only accessible as individual images. So the UI challenge before me was how to show these other types of recent uploads. At first I started to make a new screen that listed all the uploads on an account but that wasn&rsquo;t working, primary reason being that it was boring af. After mulling it over I came up with an interface that feels better as a part of Mimi, and that&rsquo;s illustrated in the video below:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>All uploads on the account show up inline with the sets of Mimi uploads in the same reverse chronological list that is in the current version. There are subtle UI differences between the two types in the list, e.g. the background color for each kind of post is different. On the top right is a filter button that lets you filter for one type or another, if you choose to do so.</p>
<p>Exporting still works the same way with a right swipe. Sets of uploads made from Mimi can still be deleted with a left swipe. As always this only deletes the batch from Mimi and doesn&rsquo;t affect the uploaded images. Other uploads don&rsquo;t offer the deletion because they are representing the images on Micro.blog and not an uploaded set. This <em>may</em> cause confusion but I currently don&rsquo;t have a design to avoid that. Got ideas?</p>
<p>I should have a beta out by this weekend so you can try this feature out if you like. To get on the beta, <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/AbjtGWge">sign up for it with TestFlight</a>.</p>

			 <p>Over the last week I framed and installed a window in the shed in our yard.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As part of this project, I also started using a &ldquo;real&rdquo; video editor. I&rsquo;ve edited videos in the past using iMovie, but this was quite different, as expected, and it was fun to pick up a lot of the beginner level skills in the process.</p>
<p>The editor I used was DaVinci Resolve, mostly because it has a version available for free and it is a very capable app for video editing on the Mac.</p>
<p>I watched a YouTube video to learn how to get going and to get familiar with the interface. Then I would search when I wanted to figure out how to do something specific as I went along e.g. extracting a frame to use as a thumbnail.</p>
<p><strong>Update: 18th May, 2022.</strong></p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago I finally got around to putting a frame on the window.</p>
<p>The other window on the shed has angled ends on the top piece, so I measured and mirrored them on the top piece of this one. I cut it on the table saw as shown in the photo below.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2022/6a900f49b6.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2022/6a900f49b6.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s a photo of the window with the frame.</p>

<p>Maybe next month I&rsquo;ll get around to painting it…</p>

			 <p>Before our return to Portland from Tucson, I was really looking forward to flying over Arizona and Utah because there are so many landscapes there that I adore and have seen from the ground as well.</p>
<p>And the views did not disappoint! Here are a few along with my best guess for the place.</p>

			 <p>I went on a photowalk with my friend Andrew today and got to try a really old Leica lens that he found in a thrift store recently. It was a <a href="https://www.kenrockwell.com/leica/135mm-f45.htm">Leitz Hektor 135mm f/4.5</a> and was probably made in the 1950s.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/4dd9da9f1e.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/4dd9da9f1e.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s remarkable how I can just attach this nearly 70 year old lens to my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leica_M10">Leica M10</a>, a modern digital camera made just a few years ago. I&rsquo;ve read how Leica M maintains compatibility with the oldest products but today I got to try out. It just works!</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/613f2c27de.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/613f2c27de.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Focusing was a bit tricky to start but I got the hang of it after a few photos.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/b3b4b835b9.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/b3b4b835b9.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Then I had to start &ldquo;seeing&rdquo; with this long focal length. That took a minute. I&rsquo;m used to a 35mm or 50mm lens and this is <em>very</em> different.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/b22919a1c0.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/b22919a1c0.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Got some okay photos. I had no expectation to start composing anything worthwhile with this in an hour.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/228851792d.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/228851792d.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t go wrong with a store window selfie though 😄</p>

<p>a) I like it for reasons I describe in this <a href="https://twitter.com/samgrover/status/1425129915947438086">twitter thread</a>.</p>

			 <p>💰 Financial (Pro?) Tip for US based folks: You can get a free credit report from the main bureaus via <a href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com/">annualcreditreport.com</a>. Once per year per bureau. I’ve been getting them regularly for years to review what creditors have on file. However I get a report from each of the three bureaus every four months. That way I have a little insight into my credit every four months and I can spread them out to once per year per bureau so they are always free. The site can feel a little clunky but it is a good resource IMHO.</p>

<p><strong>Update (9th August, 2021):</strong> I took it in to the Apple store today after making an appointment at the Genius Bar. They took it in for an hour and repaired it. Not sure if they replaced the entire 1x camera module but the issue is gone 🎉</p>

			 <p>While at the coast last weekend, we went on an excursion to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neskowin_Ghost_Forest">Neskowin Ghost Forest</a>.</p>
<p>That day it was a foggy with columns of rising steam visible. I&rsquo;m not sure if this is common there but it sure added to the spookiness of the name.</p>
<p>As in many parts of the Oregon coast there were rock formations of various sizes that dot the landscape and make it ever more interesting than just a sandy beach.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://samgrover.com/2021/06/21/mimi-uploader-is.html">Mimi Uploader 2021.1 is out with main screen layout updates and a tip jar 🎉</a></h1>

<p>The new version features a new layout system for the main screen to better view your picked images. This layout scales to maximize your content for all screen sizes and orientations. As you can see in the comparison above, the same six photos are viewed with better detail in the new layout.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/be2b12849f.png"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/be2b12849f.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>This version also features a new button on the main screen in the toolbar at the bottom. Toggling this fits or fills each image in the space available to it. The comparison above shows each state for six chosen photos of varying aspect ratios.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/c79662d301.png"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/c79662d301.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Also in this update is a new Tip Jar in the Settings screen. Mimi Uploader has always been offered at a one-time fixed price. The addition of new features and all upkeep is complimentary, so any tips to support that effort are greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thank you for your support! 😊</p>

<p>A new TestFlight beta of Mimi Uploader is out for testing with this Tip Jar. If things look good, I should be able to release a new version in a few days with the new layout and image display options, in addition to this.</p>

<p>This is my first Sailor pen. I got it as a present and have been pleasantly surprised at how nice it is to use and hold. I really wasn&rsquo;t expecting this level of quality in this price range. I use it daily with my work notebook. 🖋</p>

			 <p>I built a wall-mounted rack for a bathroom and am quite happy with how it turned out.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/8b8ad3aee8.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/8b8ad3aee8.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The bathroom on the main level in our house is used occasionally by us. It is also the one that is used by visitors. It has never had a good place to put stuff. The sink doesn&rsquo;t have enough room on it for anything besides the soap, and there is no vanity cabinet in which to put things. We decided a long time ago that there needed to be something.</p>
<p>It is a small room, so the only real option was a wall, and this was pretty much the only place to mount something like this on the wall in a manner that it wasn&rsquo;t in the way, or in an awkward spot.</p>
<p>At some point I came across <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h69ZB-P8W8w">this video</a> and realized that this design could work well. The main constraint as shown in the video was depth. This was also the case in our bathroom so as to not interfere with the shower door next to it. A secondary constraint was the light switches but that was straightforward to design around. Also, unlike that video, I couldn&rsquo;t drill the sides into a wall because there is just trim board on one side and stone tiles on the other. So I made some adjustments to adapt that design to our needs.</p>
<p>And so many months ago I got the materials. Then something or the other delayed the project but a couple months ago I finally started on it. And in small increments I built it up. A few weeks ago and after some mistakes and corrections, I finally applied paint and finish, and mounted it.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how it looks in perspective with a wide angle lens.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/7fa7f36ee2.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/7fa7f36ee2.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>P.S. The video I linked is from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIrtu3uSwehD0pfmfMsHhUA">Darbin Orvar</a> channel, of which I&rsquo;m a fan, and have followed for many years. Highly recommended!</p>

			 <p>A new beta of Mimi Uploader will be coming your way shortly. This includes layout updates for the main screen for all screen sizes and orientations.</p>
<p>It also includes a new button to toggle viewing images in their entirety. Here&rsquo;s an example.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/2e3a58cc07.png"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/2e3a58cc07.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>On the left is the way images will show by default, but tapping the new button in the bottom toolbar scales the images so they fit in their available space, as shown on the right.</p>
<p>Try it out and let me know what you think 😊</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m trying out a new image layout algorithm for the main screen on Mimi Uploader. The idea is to utilize more of the screen real estate and to adjust the size of each photo based on the total number.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a before/after in the portrait orientation.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/92b6a70727.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/92b6a70727.jpg" alt=""></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m quite encouraged by this and already finding it useful in development.</p>

			 <p>A new version of <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mimi-uploader/id1484555696">Mimi Uploader</a> is now out with my favorite new feature in a while. <strong>You can now access your Recent Uploads for reference or export!</strong> 🎉</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/5627108d83.png"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/5627108d83.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Recent Uploads can be accessed by the icon on the top left of the main screen. Once in there, you can see a list of your ten most recent uploads sessions. Each of those can be independently exported to get the URLs in Markdown or HTML. Now if you miss exporting right after an upload, or somehow lose the exported text, you can still get to it later. I hope you enjoy this feature and find it useful like I do.</p>
<p>This release has been a long time coming. Working on this app is another one of those things that&rsquo;s slowed down in the pandemic. I&rsquo;m hoping to give it more attention in the future and have a list of features and improvements that I would like to bring to you.</p>
<p>If you find Mimi useful, please let others know, and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mimi-uploader/id1484555696">leave a rating and/or review</a>. It is very much appreciated.</p>

<p>For those of us who use an Apple Watch, you can now unlock your Face ID equipped phone when wearing a mask. This works very well. You can find it in Settings -&gt; Face ID &amp; Passcode and scrolling down. &ldquo;Mercury&rdquo; in the screenshot is the name I&rsquo;ve given my watch.</p>

<p>Now you can opt out of any systematic tracking by apps. If you leave that switch on, some apps will ask you for permission and you can allow or deny on a case by case basis. It was off and I&rsquo;ve left it as is. You can find it in Settings -&gt; Privacy -&gt; Tracking.</p>

			 <p>Last week NASA landed the Perseverance rover on Mars. I watched live the entry, descent, and landing phase as events happened. It was quite exciting.</p>
<p>Today they released a set of high definition videos from various cameras that captured the descent and landing in amazing detail. This is a first and wow, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4czjS9h4Fpg">that footage is incredible</a>!</p>
<p>NASA also released the first ever audio recorded on another planet. Today I heard the <a href="https://soundcloud.com/nasa/first-sounds-from-mars-filters-out-rover-self-noise">breeze on Mars</a>. Amazing!</p>
<p>Perseverance carries with it the Ingenuity helicopter. So we will have the first powered flight on Mars to look forward to in the near future. And I&rsquo;ll be sure to tune in for that.</p>
<p>All the media will be available in the public domain via the <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/">Perseverance site</a>.</p>

			 <p>About a week ago we were at the beginning of a &ldquo;historic&rdquo; winter storm. It had waves of various kinds of precipitation. Snow, sleet, ice, freezing rain, rain.</p>
<p>At the end of it there was the thickest layers of ice on everything that I&rsquo;d ever seen in these parts.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/de1b0dab31.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/de1b0dab31.jpg" alt=""></a></p>

<p>We lost power on Sunday night at 7pm. Thankfully, it was restored on Monday at 1:30pm. At one point we emptied the fridge of perishables and placed them in a cooler outside. At least there was plenty of ice around to keep things cold 😄. I&rsquo;m grateful that this was a minor inconvenience to us compared to what many others are going through with recent weather.</p>
<p>All in all over 500,000 people were without power around here due to various causes, like downed power lines, equipment failures, substation failures. Crews have been working 24/7 to restore utilities.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/503f168836.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/503f168836.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>It all began to thaw that Monday afternoon as the temperatures rose and the Sun came out for a while.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/3cb05aa33c.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/3cb05aa33c.jpg" alt=""></a></p>

<p>Now several days later, there&rsquo;s still plenty of downed tree branches, and snow on the ground thawing slowly. Temperatures have remained above freezing but sunshine is still rare.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday I finished reading The Broken Earth Trilogy by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N._K._Jemisin">N.K. Jemisin</a>.</p>
<p>I read the first book last year. I was sufficiently intrigued that I bought the second book soon after, but for whatever reason I didn&rsquo;t start reading it until a couple of months ago. Fortunately it starts in a way that helped recall the story within the first few chapters. It then built upon the world and the characters as any good middle book. Once I&rsquo;d finished that, I couldn&rsquo;t wait to read the third one. I bought it right away and read it voraciously over the last two weeks. It did a great job of tying it all together and was very satisfying.</p>
<p>These books have been my introduction to the work of N.K. Jemisin and I&rsquo;m looking forward to reading more of her work in the future.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Last year <a href="https://samgrover.com/2019/05/26/we-made-a.html">we built a gardening bed</a> in the spring and used it for summer vegetables and for garlic over the winter. A bed in that region of our yard did a lot better than our existing beds, especially for tomatoes, so we decided that we would build a new one next to it in 2020.</p>
<p>Well, last weekend we built that new gardening bed. It&rsquo;s the end of the main vegetable growing season but it is also the time to plant garlic. The ones from last year came out great. Apparently you should rotate the bed you use for garlic, so that became the impetus to get the new one set up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d bought some 4x4 lumber almost two months ago for this. Some weeks ago I&rsquo;d cut ten pieces down to half with my Japanese pull saw. I love that saw. It makes cutting thick lumber pretty much effortless.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/b084ec0270.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/b084ec0270.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>We went to <a href="https://portlandnursery.com">our local gardening store</a> and bought 14 bags of 3 cubic feet of raised bed potting mix. Borrowing a truck from my friend made that easy. Oh and it was fun to drive a stick shift after a long time.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/6c2e80d2f4.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/6c2e80d2f4.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>We cleared the space next to the previous bed, leveled it, laid down the fabric and finalized the location.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/37a9247071.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/37a9247071.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Then came the part of assembling the structure. I had used 6&quot; construction lag screws, with a 5/16&quot; shaft last time. So I went and bought more. The ones I bought this time were a bit different and proved to be a little harder to use. After some trial and error, the final process involved pre-drilling with a long 3/16&quot; bit and screwing in the lag screw after that. Here&rsquo;s a comparison of the two screws. The one on the left is the new one.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/30e59e554a.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/30e59e554a.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Having resolved that we built up all the layers for the structure.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/8b6ce01f44.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/8b6ce01f44.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The final step was loading all the dirt which went by a lot faster with bags than it did with shoveling a pile last year.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/74f60c7d77.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/74f60c7d77.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Some slo-mo fun was had too!</p>

<p>A couple of days later Jenni planted all the garlic. So we&rsquo;re good to go and expecting a bunch in June 2021!</p>

			 <p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/6d0de790b1.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/6d0de790b1.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been intrigued by the idea of a video doorbell for some time now. Mostly out of technological curiosity, and sure, a little bit out of a need for convenience. We didn&rsquo;t even have a doorbell, so people visiting or leaving packages would simply knock on the door which was easy to miss.</p>
<p>At the same time, the prominent products made by large tech companies constantly stream video data from a doorbell to their servers for analysis and trade. That wasn&rsquo;t something I wanted.  So I was on the lookout for a product that would keep the video data local to my home network. It would still send data over the internet to my device if I wanted to access it, or respond to a doorbell ring, but it wouldn&rsquo;t be sending significant amounts of data that is of no value to me but has value to the surveillance industry.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I have a bit of knowledge on tech stuff, so I can setup and manage a home network. I have wired ethernet cables in my house, and have slowly upgraded my network to use more advanced networking equipment made by Ubiquiti, rather than the stock WiFi enabled router provided by my ISP. It was with this in mind that I learned the Ubiquiti had recently launched a video doorbell in their UniFi line, which is what I use for my home networking equipment. Once I got a chance to place an order, I did, and sure enough the doorbell arrived a few days later. That was the easy part.</p>
<p>Now, as I mentioned, we didn&rsquo;t have a doorbell, so we didn&rsquo;t even have wiring for it. I did some research, and figured out how I wanted to wire it. It&rsquo;s a low voltage circuit that requires a step-down AC transformer. Normally that is attached to the wiring directly at a box in an inaccessible area, but I found a solution where I could access a wall outlet and so wouldn&rsquo;t need to drill into a wall or floor. A friend had a plug-in transformer that he wasn&rsquo;t using, so all I needed was some wire, which I ordered. I also ordered a mechanical chime that would ring when the doorbell was pressed. I drew this rough sketch of how I imagined it getting wired.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/434d226695.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/434d226695.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>At this point I set up a circuit on my desk and wired everything up. First it was just the doorbell which was easy to start and setup. Then I wired in the chime and tested that everything worked fine, which it did 🎉</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/cf13bb3d05.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/cf13bb3d05.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>I was able to use an existing wire path for part of the way from the outlet to the door, so I got going by pulling wire through that. I drilled a hole next to the door, ran the wire through and installed the doorbell. Once again I tested that it was working fine. Next I installed the chime on the wall above the door on the inside and connected it to the circuit. And that was it for the wiring. Everything worked well. The doorbell had a good signal. This is what it looked like.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/9fbf77ec30.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/9fbf77ec30.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Now all I had to do was to clean up and conceal the wiring. I didn&rsquo;t have anything for this so I researched some more and ordered some cable concealing strips. Once those arrived I set about cutting pieces to length and enclosed much of the wire by the door with it. I also hid some of the wiring in the moulding along which I had run it. That was handy and probably cut my concealing cost in half.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/afea39f4f5.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/afea39f4f5.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>So far the experience has been nice. There&rsquo;s still issues with the integration of the app. The notification always fires when the doorbell rings, but live video and audio can be cut off some times. These are software issues and I hope they get resolved soon. A new app update came out while I was writing this post and that greatly improved the performance of showing video right after launching the app. It&rsquo;s good to know they are making improvements like I had hoped.</p>
<p>In these pandemic days it&rsquo;s mostly just package delivery people coming by and I&rsquo;ve noticed that only about half of them ring the doorbell. There have been no times when I&rsquo;ve needed to talk to someone. I&rsquo;m still dialing in the right motion triggers and sensitivity so I can minimize the false positives. Once that is the case I may even enable notifications for all motion events, if needed. There have been one or two cases when the delivery person delivered something on the porch and didn&rsquo;t trigger the motion sensing. Hopefully those will get ironed out. I can still see those because I&rsquo;ve set things up to record all video on a buffer that lasts several days. The interface for recorded video is great and makes it really easy to look at relevant events which get logged.</p>
<p>Overall I&rsquo;m pretty happy with it. It was an interesting project where I tackled and solved problems that were new-to-me and that&rsquo;s always the best part.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday was one of those amazing Fall days when the sky is clear and the air is crisp. After going through ten days dealing with wildfire smoke, and another few days of overcast skies and much-needed rain, it was a welcome change. So, we went out for a short hike in <a href="https://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/Tolinda-Ridge_Trail_Loop_Hike">the Forest Park area</a>.</p>
<p>There are nice views from the trail. This is at a viewpoint very close to the start. St John&rsquo;s Bridge, with Mt. St. Helens and Mt. Rainier in the distance.</p>

<p>Mt. Hood, as seen from St John&rsquo;s Bridge. We couldn&rsquo;t get parking at the trailhead so we parked at the other end of the bridge and walked over it. That was an additional bit of fun despite my not-so-great feelings of looking down from it 😅.</p>

<p>After the hike we ended up at this recently opened food cart pod and had a meal there. This was the first time we&rsquo;ve eaten out since the pandemic started. It was a bit unnerving for me to be in the midst of so many people without masks but overall it was enjoyable.</p>

			 <p>The new version requires iOS 14 and utilizes its new system photo picker. This enables you to easily browse and search your entire library to add photos to upload. You are no longer restricted to the recent few thousand photos.</p>
<p>As a result of this change Mimi no longer requires or asks for Photos permission. Yay for privacy! You will never be prompted for that again. Only the photos you explicitly add will now be accessible to Mimi and shown in the grid.</p>
<p>This update also adds:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for PNG files to preserve their format.</li>
<li>Larger photo preview in the grid.</li>
<li>Contextual menus on photos in the grid and on some action buttons. Press and hold to discover these.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you will like this update and please do let me know any feedback you may have. I&rsquo;m now working on adding new features to the app and hope to write about that soon. Thank you for your continued support! 😊</p>

			<h1><a href="https://samgrover.com/2020/09/08/excited-about-the.html">Excited about the next version of Mimi Uploader for iOS 14</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://samgrover.com/2020/09/08/excited-about-the.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-09-08 16:09:46 -0700">Sep 8, 2020</time></a>

			 <p>For various reasons, I&rsquo;ve not been able to give Mimi the time and attention I&rsquo;d hoped over the last several months, but I&rsquo;m actively trying to change that. I&rsquo;m working on an update that takes a fresh approach to the photo selection flow by utilizing new features coming in iOS 14.</p>
<p>iOS 14 has a powerful new system provided photo picker that lets users pick photos from their library. The new picker has great features for browsing, searching, making multiple selections, etc. This is perfect for apps like Mimi where people can pick the photos they want to upload with minimum friction and with an experience that feels true to iOS. I&rsquo;m very conscious of privacy in apps, so it gives me great joy to note that with this new picker Mimi will no longer need to ask for Photos permission.</p>
<p>I had planned to enhance the original photo selection screen with new features for better selection, but now I can utilize that time towards other features that folks have requested. Features that I think will be a lot more useful in the long term, like support for the share sheet, and drag and drop, that allows sending photos into Mimi from other apps. And I have more ideas that I hope to share after this initial set of work is complete.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to bring this new experience to you sometime after iOS 14 launches this Fall. I appreciate your support and comments. If you&rsquo;ve liked using Mimi, I&rsquo;d love it if you could <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mimi-uploader/id1484555696">give it a rating or review on the App Store</a>. Thank you!</p>

<p>Some notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>I constrained myself to photos taken on that day. No digging into the archives.</li>
<li>A lot of these were taken around the house or the neighborhood, i.e. the pandemic life.</li>
<li>There was one day where I took a photo but forgot to post and posted the next morning. So there goes my 30 day photo blogging pin on Micro.blog. Again 🤦‍♂️</li>
<li>Some days I kinda winged it, as can be seen 😬.</li>
<li>This photo challenge was managed by <a href="https://micro.welltempered.net/2020/07/23/august-photoblogging-challenge.html">@macgenie</a>.</li>
<li>The last one I did was the <a href="https://samgrover.com/2020/03/02/all-my-february.html">February photoblogging challenge</a>.</li>

			 <p>We wanted to adopt a kitten from the <a href="https://www.oregonhumane.org">Oregon Humane Society</a>. In these days of the pandemic, their adoption process has changed and you&rsquo;re only allowed to apply online. So we checked their website regularly. That&rsquo;s when we noticed that demand is very high these days so the window to apply was very short. New kittens would get posted but by the time we noticed and applied, they would already have been spoken for. This went on for a week or so.</p>
<p>So I did what any programmer might do, I implemented a script to detect when new kittens are posted. It was run every five minutes for about three weeks. Now it has been retired with the arrival of Mr. Momo a few weeks ago.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/3a6b30c57d.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/3a6b30c57d.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The script flow is pretty straightforward:</p>
<ul>
<li>Retrieve the page that lists kittens.</li>
<li>Use some regular expressions to get the relevant data out.</li>
<li>Open a local JSON file of saved kittens from the previous run so that the new kittens can be identified.</li>
<li>If there are new kittens, use <a href="https://www.pushcut.io">Pushcut</a> to send a notification to my phone (and watch).</li>
<li>If the notification is successful, save the list of currently available kittens in a local JSON file for referencing in the next run.</li>
</ul>

<p>It was loaded as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launchd"><code>launchd</code></a> service on my always-on Mac, which I manage using <a href="https://www.soma-zone.com/LaunchControl/">LaunchControl.app</a>.</p>

			 <p>I have now been subscribed to <a href="https://go.setapp.com/invite/v6jr3hc8">Setapp</a> for a while. I wrote <a href="http://samgrover.com/2019/04/14/initial-experience-with.html">a post about my initial experience</a> in April 2019. Recently I figured it was a good time to re-evaluate how it&rsquo;s working out. So here are some similar lists as last time. Apps are listed in alphabetical order.</p>
<p>Apps I&rsquo;m currently using on a regular basis:</p>
<ul>
<li>MarsEdit</li>
<li>Timing</li>
<li>Unite</li>
<li>iStatMenus</li>
</ul>
<p>Apps I use occasionally:</p>
<ul>
<li>Downie</li>
<li>Dropshare</li>
<li>Expressions</li>
<li>Folx</li>
<li>Marked</li>
<li>MindNode</li>
<li>Permute</li>
</ul>
<p>Apps that I&rsquo;ve used just once or twice or briefly for a project. These were handy when I needed them and now I know they&rsquo;re there and can use them again if a similar need arises.</p>
<ul>
<li>Archiver</li>
<li>CleanMyMacX</li>
<li>GlueMotion</li>
<li>Jump Desktop</li>
<li>TablePlus</li>
</ul>
<p>Apps that I thought I&rsquo;d use more often but haven&rsquo;t:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ulysses</li>
</ul>
<p>On the whole I think Setapp is still providing me value for the subscription and I look forward to the new apps they add. If you would like to try out Setapp, <a href="https://go.setapp.com/invite/v6jr3hc8">use my referral code</a>.</p>

<p>Ashish Grover, or Ashu, as we called him endearingly passed away on Monday, 6th July, 2020 in New York City. His passing was sudden and unexpected. It has shaken up our entire family across two vast countries. He was only 48. Now he will forever be 48.</p>
<p>Technically he was my cousin, but we grew up under the same roof in New Delhi, our mothers cooked side by side in the same kitchen, we ate at the same table. I shared his room for a while in the 80s, as our growing joint family was on the verge of becoming a nuclear one. He was my brother.</p>
<p>He was funny, full of life, and shared the joy of it at all occasions. He achieved tremendous success in his career, and would&rsquo;ve reached higher had he had the time. As we grew older, we grew apart, but only in distance, as we pursued our lives and dreams. I would only see him every few years. Those times were always wonderful. So it was a joy when he moved to the US in 2017 as I managed to see him more often then. I am grateful for that.</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/6c5ef710bb.jpg" alt="With Ashish and Manisha. New York City. September, 2018."></p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/0f7814aeb2.jpg" alt="Us. Columbia River Gorge. July, 2019."></p>
<p>His passing was not as a result of COVID-19, but that has certainly impacted all related events since then, including my inability to attend his funeral in person. I couldn&rsquo;t manage it. Others in our family managed it and showed up to support his grieving wife and daughter.</p>
<p>I attended his funeral service via a video call. There were about 25 people present in person, masked and social distanced as best as could be managed. A few hundred people were on the call. If that number feels large, know that far more would have shown up in person if this vile event had happened in better times, and at the place he had called home for twenty years. Over the last couple of weeks I&rsquo;ve heard several stories of his friendships, generosities and kindnesses. He was beloved by many.</p>
<p>Our family has set up <a href="https://ashish-grover.forevermissed.com">an online memorial site</a>. If you knew him, I encourage you to share something there if you like.</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/f81c09196a.jpg" alt="Us, with our sisters. Circa 1980s."></p>
<p>As someone said, he lives amongst the stars now. Rest in peace bhai ❤️</p>

We try and go each year around this time when the roses are in full bloom. It never disappoints, even with an overcast sky. Of course it was a little different this year, as with everything else.</p>

			 <p>A couple of days ago I finished reading <a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780441478125?aff=samgrover">The Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula K. Le Guin</a>. It was published fifty-one years ago, but feels like it could&rsquo;ve been this year. A wonderful and timeless story written with immaculate detail, and emotional depth. There were many sentences all over the book that I read more than once because they were worth savoring.</p>
<p>I first heard of Ursula K. Le Guin a long time ago. At the time I thought of her as a Fantasy author, and I used to think of myself as someone that enjoys reading Sci-Fi, but not Fantasy. It was an arbitrary distinction that I hope is behind me. But as a result I didn&rsquo;t introduce myself to her work even though she was frequently mentioned in the context of Sci-Fi. I hope to read more of her works in the future.</p>

			 <p>Just saw two great examples of tech activism.</p>
<p>First was an Instagram story where all you had to do was swipe up and that opened a webpage which then brought up an email composer filled out with an email and with email addresses populated. You just had to update placeholders with your info and hit send.</p>
<p>Second is this bot that requests people to update their black square photos on Instagram so that they don&rsquo;t drown out actual black voices using the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag: <a href="https://github.com/char/blm-instagram-bot">github.com/char/blm-&hellip;</a></p>
<p>Both are brilliant. My hats off to these folks.</p>

			 <p>About three months ago I heard of someone using a trackpad with their non-dominant hand at their Mac. Now I&rsquo;d heard of such a use before but this time I had a trackpad lying around. I&rsquo;d gotten it with my Mac instead of a mouse because I already had a mouse, but had stashed it away. So I got it out and set it up for my left hand.</p>
<p>A month passed. I was using it rarely. One day the battery in my mouse ran out in the middle of the workday, so I plugged it in and moved the trackpad over to the right side.</p>
<p>A day passed, and the mouse had long been charged, so I unplugged it, but for whatever reason I kept using the trackpad.</p>
<p>A week passed and I realized that I was liking the trackpad a lot more than the mouse. So I put the mouse in the closet.</p>
<p>Now two months have passed and I can&rsquo;t think of going back. The gestures are intuitive and I&rsquo;ve found several operations to be a lot smoother.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a happy <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MRMF2LL/A/">Magic Trackpad 2</a> user 😊.</p>

			 <p>A day off from work was a good idea. We went for a hike at Coyote Wall.</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/e93f4f1ba1.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The trails have a gentle grade and there’s plenty of room to distance ourselves when we come across other people.</p>

<p>Lovely views. Small streams and falls. Birds and flowers.</p>

			 <p>Inspired by Patrick Rhone&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.patrickrhone.net/reading/">/reading</a> page, I&rsquo;ve created a <a href="https://samgrover.com/books/">Books page</a> on my site.</p>
<p>Following is the process I followed to make that happen on my Mac:</p>
<ul>
<li>Export all my books out of Goodreads. You can find the page to do that by navigating to &ldquo;My Books&rdquo; and selecting &ldquo;Import and export&rdquo; at the bottom of the left sidebar under &ldquo;Tools&rdquo;. The exported file is of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV format</a>, which is pretty standard.</li>
<li>Open the export file in a spreadsheeting app. I use <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/numbers/id409203825?mt=12">Numbers.app</a>. Here, you can clean up any data. I added some ISBNs that were missing. I also saved this file so I can just update it in the future as I read books. Another reason I went through this step was because I was having a hard time parsing the original CSV file using the script I wrote.</li>
<li>Export the spreadsheet file as CSV.</li>
<li>Run it through the script below to generate Markdown that can be pasted directly into the page on my site.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it!</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the script:</p>

<p>Some notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>I constrained myself to photos taken on that day. No digging into the archives.</li>
<li>A lot of these were taken around the house or the neighborhood. I work from home and tend to go on walks at various times during the day.</li>
<li>Some days I took the photo but forgot to post and posted the next morning.</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t usually do photo challenges, daily or otherwise, so this was harder than I expected. Some days I kinda winged it, as can be seen 😜.</li>

			 <p>Hello friends!</p>
<p>I’m very excited to announce the launch and availability of my new app, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mimi-uploader/id1484555696">Mimi Uploader</a>.</p>
<p>Mimi is designed from the ground up to enable super fast uploading of photos from your device to your Micro.blog hosted blogs. Utilize Mimi to upload a set of photos for making your blog post. Maybe a road trip, or a party, or memories of a special day.</p>
<p>Here’s a video of Mimi in action:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I found myself uploading batches of photos to Micro.blog fairly frequently, usually to have them all in a blog post about an activity, or event, or a photo essay. I designed and developed Mimi to make that flow as seamless as possible.</p>
<p>It works just as well for single photo posts. I’ve been using it all month for the February photo blogging challenge.</p>
<p>I hope you find it as useful as I do 😊</p>

			 <p>As of the last several years, I’ve spent a lot less time gaming than before. I&rsquo;m basically an occasional gamer. It is with that in mind that I recently sold my PS4 which was lying unused, and bought a subscription to Apple Arcade that let&rsquo;s me play games on several devices and for short windows of time.</p>
<p>I’ve played a few games on it now, and by far my favorite has been “<a href="https://www.whatthegolf.com">WHAT THE GOLF?</a>”. I don’t think I’ve had as much fun playing a game in a while. I fire it up a few times a week on my iPhone and make a little progress each time. It is interesting, inventive, clever, and above all, hilarious. I’m 77% through the game and savoring the last of it. I hope this team makes more games and I look forward to them.</p>

<li>That deep breath you just took after a particular notification rang on a particular device.</li>
<li>That bag of chips you opened a short while after you took that deep breath.</li>

<p>And of course, correlating this data to the time, date, current weather conditions, and past behavior.</p>
<p>Perhaps the company that makes the assistant also knows the content of those notifications and everything else happening on that device because they make that as well.</p>

			 <p>A couple of weeks ago we went on a bike ride on the <a href="https://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/Banks-Vernonia_Traverse_Hike">Banks Vernonia State Trail</a> on the outskirts of the Portland metro area. It was a lovely Fall day. We started at Banks Trailhead, rode for a while past the Buxton Trestle bridge, and then returned the same way. A lot of the way was flat and some parts had a gentle slope. We had a great time. Following are some photos from then.</p>

			 <p>Part of my gym routine involves using a treadmill. And each time after I complete that, I take a photo of the readout.</p>
<p>This morning I took one with my new iPhone 11 Pro and got the following photo.</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/d9b9918c82.jpg" alt="Clipped"></p>
<p>As you can see, parts of the readout were invisible or clipped. I think it is because the speed of the default camera app in those conditions is just too fast in comparison to the refresh rates on that LED readout. The cameras can go really fast with shutter speeds, but there’s a lot of computational photography involved, so the final composite shutter speed may vary.</p>
<p>Luckily I noticed this right away, and decided to use the new “night mode” feature which allows you to effectively slow down the shutter speed while maintaining stability. And that got me the following photo.</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/baabe6aeb7.jpg" alt="Proper, with longer exposure."></p>
<p>Phew! This is readable.</p>
<p>P.S. For details on the new camera capabilities, check out <a href="https://blog.halide.cam/iphone-11-pro-preview-the-camera-hardware-changes-16a543b77c24" title="iPhone 11 Pro Preview: The Camera Hardware Changes">this great article by Halide</a>.</p>

			 <p>I’ve been using a <a href="https://www.owcdigital.com/products/thunderbay-4">OWC Thunderbay 4 (Thunderbolt 2)</a> external enclosure with four 3 TB hard disk drives for the last two years. I bought it on eBay as a new but opened product. It’s been great. I had two of the drives in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_RAID_levels#RAID_0">RAID 0</a> configuration (for higher bandwidth single volume) and they were serving as the primary storage of about 1 TB of photos.</p>
<p>Recently I decided to partially upgrade that setup by purchasing a Crucial 2 TB SSD. In order to install it I also had to purchase a <a href="https://eshop.macsales.com/item/OWC/MEQX3TRAY/">OWC Spare Drive Tray</a> since the ones in my Thunderbay didn’t have the right setup for 2.5” drives. That took a few days to arrive. In the meantime I installed the SSD into an old USB LaCie enclosure and moved my files over to it.</p>
<p>I decided to measure the drive performance as I went through this process. And for that I used <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blackmagic-disk-speed-test/id425264550?mt=12">Blackmagic Disk Speed Test</a> which is available for free on the Mac App Store.</p>
<p>Each disk in my original setup had about 190 MB/s read/write speed.</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/555d71e507.jpg" alt="Individual hard disk performance in Thunderbay 4."></p>
<p>The RAID 0 gave me about 300-320 MB/s. I forgot to speed test it before I removed it, but that’s what I recall from back when I first set it up.</p>
<p>In the intermediate setup with the LaCie enclosure I got about 250 MB/s write and 270 MB/s read speed.</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/db8b2160a7.jpg" alt="SSD inside LaCie enclosure."></p>
<p>Once the drive tray arrived, I moved the SSD over to that and into the Thunderbay for the final setup where I’m now getting about 350 MB/s write and about 380 MB/s read speed.</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/7d7e7f5628.jpg" alt="SSD in Thunderbay."></p>
<p>I may be able to extract some more performance from this SSD by making some other purchases and changes, but I don’t feel compelled to do that at this time. This is better than what I had, and quite acceptable for my use. In fact I felt totally comfortable moving my iCloud Photo library over to it as well. This freed up about a third of my internal drive storage.</p>
<p>I could’ve done this sooner but the tradeoff of storage size vs. price didn’t seem worth it. In the future I may keep an eye on the price of such drives and pick up at sale to upgrade more of my Thunderbay drives.</p>
<p>And in the foolhardy-comparison-department, here’s the crazy fast speed on the internal SSD on my iMac (Retina 5K, 27”, 2017 model).</p>

<p>Two and a half years ago, my lower back had gotten so bad that I couldn&rsquo;t walk for more than a few minutes at a time without having to stop to sit or squat. Then came surgery, recovery, return of ability, and progression from there on. Yesterday I hiked up <a href="https://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/Dog_Mountain_Hike">Dog Mountain</a>. It was the most strenuous hike I&rsquo;ve ever done. And as I sit here all sore the next day, I&rsquo;m incredibly grateful to be able to do that.</p>
<p>Due to it&rsquo;s incredible popularity, and limited parking, the Forest Service has been issuing permits for weekend days. Jenni bought ours a while ago, and we have been making small preparations ever since. Purchasing some gear (<a href="https://www.rei.com/product/148595/rei-co-op-flash-22-print-pack">backpack</a>, <a href="https://hydrapak.com/products/shape-shift-3-liter">water reservoir</a>, hiking poles), and going on light to moderate hikes starting in early Spring. Although we didn&rsquo;t go on any hike for over a month before this, and that was a mistake.</p>
<p>We arrived at the trailhead just before 9:30am, met up with our friends, and started the hike a few minutes later. About half a mile up is a &ldquo;difficulty fork&rdquo; 😂</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/41ab47c447.jpg" alt="Group at difficulty fork"></p>
<p>For the first 2.5 to 3 miles the trail is like many others in the Gorge, comprising of switchbacks through the woods.</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/57ee4dfe13.jpg" alt="Tree in the forest"></p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/fd6f11f750.jpg" alt="Mossy, dreamy forest"></p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/2220be6561.jpg" alt="Double trunks"></p>
<p>Halfway to the top the trail emerged from the forest briefly for a sweeping vista of the river and the gorge.</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/d77e20366b.jpg" alt="Vista of river"></p>
<p>For the last half mile going up, we were out of the trees and surrounded by wildflowers. It was here that the wind also picked up significantly. This final stretch afforded gorgeous view all the way, with our trail surrounded by steep slopes full of wildflowers.</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/01d37e049d.jpg" alt="Emerging into the clearance"></p>

<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/4fd95d3143.jpg" alt="Wildflower photography on the edge"></p>
<p>The views at the summit were incredible. Some fast moving clouds engulfed us soon after we arrived. That was quite a show before it cleared up in a few minutes. It was time to put on another layer. We sat there and enjoyed the views as we had lunch comprising of tasty sandwiches that Jenni had made, and some chips.</p>

<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/631daf21e2.jpg" alt="Lunch at the top"></p>
<p>As we started back down, my IT band was hurting on the outer side of each of my knees. I was annoyed at myself for not having taken the time to go on hikes and do regular stretches since the <a href="https://samgrover.com/2019/04/30/hiking-at-coyote.html">Coyote Wall hike</a> from over a month ago. Every downward step was painful. Soon Jenni reminded me of the cross-leg stretches and those helped. Those and the hiking poles were incredibly helpful in making the descent.</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/fc8ebfc65d.jpg" alt="Stretches on the trail. Photo by Jenni."></p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/90ddff0bac.jpg" alt="Heading back down"></p>
<p>Heading back down we reentered the forest, and it sheltered us from the sun and wind for the rest of the way.</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/a1ab443d81.jpg" alt="Staggered view of the group"></p>
<p>All in all this was a great hike with friends, and brought tremendous satisfaction on a personal level. It is entirely possible that someday my back may go bad again, but I&rsquo;m grateful that I can do this today, and motivated to keep it this way. I&rsquo;m also grateful for Jenni who has been supportive and encouraging all along the way ❤️</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m feeling a love-hate relationship with activity streaks. While it is nice to have a streak and motivating to keep it going, I feel some anxiety coming along with it.</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/26478fd52c.jpg" alt="March activity streak"></p>
<p>So, in an effort to avoid the unhealthy side effects, I am going to willfully break streaks.</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/e08e076050.jpg" alt="April activity streak"></p>
<p>This one has gone for some time. And today I&rsquo;m ending it.</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/bb473b1bda.jpg" alt="May activity streak"></p>
<p>A positive effect of a streak is that it helps to develop a habit, and I&rsquo;d like to think that it has been the case this time. Let&rsquo;s see if that lasts.</p>
<p>P.S. For those unfamiliar, these charts show the activity tracking that is done by my <a href="https://www.apple.com/watch/">Apple Watch</a>.</p>

<p>The mail and keys organizer located just inside our home entrance had to go. It couldn&rsquo;t handle our lifestyle, by which I mean, hold a bunch of mail of varying sizes for a bunch of days. Oh, and some keys and the super long IKEA shoehorn (the best!).</p>
<p>I began to dream up a new replacement as a woodworking project. I made a Pinterest board to get some design inspiration. Then one day I just sat down and sketched it out using <a href="https://www.goodnotes.com">GoodNotes</a> on my <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> using an <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/aadfa0bb9c.jpg" alt="Initial sketch of the organizer" title="Initial sketch of the organizer"></p>
<p>I&rsquo;d imagined that the plywood would be 1/2&quot; thick, but after some discussion with Jenni, we decided to go for the <em>chonk</em> look that was distinctive of the <a href="https://samgrover.com/2019/03/25/a-tabletop-shelfbox.html">tabletop shelf/box</a> I made a couple of months ago. This lowered the costs as well since I already had  enough scraps of the baltic birch plywood. All I needed was the dark walnut stain, a birch dowel, and hanging hardware. The mail holders are held together by glue, and attached to the back by screws drilled in from behind. The pegs are held in by glue. There were a couple other changes as evident from the sketch and the photo of the final piece.</p>
<p>The groove detail in the pegs was Jenni&rsquo;s idea. I tried a couple of ways to cut it out and landed upon just keeping the table saw blade low and using my crosscut sled to spin the dowel in place over the blade. That worked wonderfully!</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/e2e7935f06.jpg" alt="Groove detail in pegs" title="Groove detail in pegs"></p>
<p>I finished the build a few weeks ago but the hardware I bought to hang it didn&rsquo;t work well. Then other things took up some time so I finally procured some new hardware and hung it up this week. We&rsquo;re both very happy with how it turned out.</p>
<p>And in parting, here&rsquo;s a photo of the old organizer trying hard to keep up.</p>

			 <p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/98821278f6.jpg" alt="Kyla, Herbie, Jenni, and Kelly near the top"></p>
<p>Last weekend we went hiking at <a href="https://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/Coyote_Wall_Hike">Coyote Wall</a>. Jenni and I had never been to this hike before but our friends were familiar with it.</p>
<p>There are multiple trails that meet each other at various points. Some are gentle slopes, while others are steeper. One can pick and choose paths based on how much of a workout one wants and switch that around as needed.</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/0ed951ee0d.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>There are beautiful vistas all along the way to the top of the wall. I could see myself bringing family and friends here that are not used to hiking much, to just go for a bit, enjoy the views, and head back.</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/c9bc70af23.jpg" alt="">

<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/e3a9317ab9.jpg" alt="Herbie was happy to lead us for a bit"></p>
<p>There are cute little waterfalls and streams as well along the way.</p>

<img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/8ae92658b4.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Spring flowers, sunny weather, and spotty clouds, made everything look a lot more beautiful.</p>

<p>At the top, we hung out for a bit to have snacks and enjoy the views some more.</p>

<img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/a1221a6215.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>On the way down we took the steeper route for a bit. Some folks were mountain biking along the cliff and down the steep trails, which was incredible to watch but not something I see myself doing 😅</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/77c43ee5df.jpg" alt="">
<img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/c48e3a44fa.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I can see myself coming back to this hike again in the spring, and probably in other seasons as well.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been journaling in <a href="https://dayoneapp.com">Day One</a> for some time now. I like it for a lot of reasons, and it&rsquo;s working out great. So far I&rsquo;ve been using it as a plain old journal, where you write what&rsquo;s on your mind. Recently, I decided that I wanted to get my digital history into it as well. One of the first things that came to mind was my <a href="https://foursquare.com">Foursquare/Swarm</a> checkin history which goes back to 2009. I decided to start there.</p>
<p>I exported all my data and wrote a script in Python to extract what I needed from it to make journal entries. The two relevant files were <code>checkins.json</code> and <code>photos.json</code>. You can <a href="https://gist.github.com/samgrover/26939e0b68a26b7fe03a7a4bd37bdcf6">get my script on Github by selecting here</a> if you&rsquo;d like to use it, or dig into it. It should also appear embedded at the end of this post. First the script pre-processes the data to get all the photos attached to checkins. Then it goes over the checkin history to extract most of what I want, but since the exported data doesn&rsquo;t include venue coordinates, it has to do a little more.</p>
<p>It makes calls to the <a href="https://developer.foursquare.com/docs">Foursquare API</a> to fetch the venue coordinates for each checkin. Then it puts everything together and makes the actual entry using Day One&rsquo;s <a href="http://dayoneapp.com/support/CLI">command line utility</a>. I had several thousand entries but the free plan for the API has a daily limit of 500 calls, so I manually ran it a few times over the course of a couple of weeks until they&rsquo;d all been imported. I could&rsquo;ve automated that but I wasn&rsquo;t keen on spending the time on that.</p>
<p>Day One does allow one to link it to <a href="https://help.dayoneapp.com/tips-and-tutorials/using-ifttt-with-day-one">IFTTT</a> so that all <em>new</em> checkins get logged automatically, and I enabled that a while back, but I&rsquo;ve not been happy with that integration. Now that I&rsquo;m familiar with the flow of data, I plan to create new entries every couple of months or so, perhaps with a new script that works entirely with the API.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to hear if you have automated any journaling as I&rsquo;m keen to explore other ways of doing so myself.</p>

			 <p>I signed up for <a href="https://go.setapp.com/invite/v6jr3hc8">Setapp</a> for a free trial week. Setapp is an app subscription service for macOS where you sign up for $10 a month to gain full access to a catalog of over 100 apps.</p>
<p>This is not a review of Setapp, but rather my initial experience with it after having heard about it a few times on the <a href="https://www.relay.fm/mpu/">Mac Power Users</a> podcast. Many of apps in the Setapp catalog are well known and as such I was already aware of them. But there are several that are new to me.</p>
<p>Apps that I found myself using often during the trial:</p>
<ul>
<li>Marked</li>
<li>Mindnode</li>
<li>Flume</li>
<li>Timing</li>
<li>iStat Menus</li>
</ul>
<p>Apps I installed and use occasionally and would expect to use occasionally in the future:</p>
<ul>
<li>WiFi Explorer</li>
<li>World Clock Pro</li>
</ul>
<p>Apps I tried but then uninstalled after using just one or two times:</p>
<ul>
<li>CleanMyMac X</li>
<li>IconJar</li>
<li>Luminar Flex</li>
</ul>
<p>Apps that are included in Setapp but which I&rsquo;ve previously bought individually and use anyway:</p>
<ul>
<li>Screens</li>
<li>Paw</li>
<li>Sip</li>
</ul>
<p>So with a very rough mental calculation I think the math would work out alright. Of course the main hook/promise of Setapp is the <em>potential</em> of all the other apps. Many may not be relevant today but may become relevant tomorrow. Their <a href="https://support.setapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000890969-Setapp-applications">stated goal</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have 100+ apps in the stack and are steadily adding more of them to cover all of your main needs. Eventually, Setapp is to deliver about 300 Mac apps, all per a single $9.99 fee (+ taxes).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have already identified some apps that I plan to use soon but just didn&rsquo;t have a chance to use during the trial period. I&rsquo;ve now subscribed for one month, and if it still seems useful after that, I will likely switch to the annual plan for 10% off.</p>
<p>If you would like to try out Setapp, <a href="https://go.setapp.com/invite/v6jr3hc8">select here to use my referral code</a>.</p>

<p>Last Saturday we went hiking at <a href="https://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/Angels_Rest_Hike">Angel&rsquo;s Rest</a> in the gorge. I&rsquo;ve been on this hike several times and always enjoy it. It is only a thirty minute drive from home, and offers great views and a good workout.</p>
<p><img src="http://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2019/88bb5df549.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This trail, along with many others had been closed for over a year since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle_Creek_Fire">Eagle Creek Fire</a>, and had reopened last fall.</p>
<p><img src="http://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2019/a49110943e.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>All the way from the trailhead to the viewpoint on the top of the cliff there were charred trees. I&rsquo;ve never hiked through a place devastated by fire before, so it was a new an interesting experience from that regard.</p>
<p><img src="http://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2019/977f3a474e.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="http://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2019/2aea63ac05.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Some areas on the trail were a bit muddy with puddles but mostly it was fine.</p>
<p><img src="http://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2019/daffebc942.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="http://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2019/3263620192.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Jenni wanted a shelf in the kitchen to organize things a little better and I wanted to make different kinds of boxes. That&rsquo;s how this came to be.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a beginner woodworker and always on the lookout for new projects that I can use as an excuse to learn new skills, and let&rsquo;s be honest, to buy new tools. For this project I ended up buying a new blade for my table saw. One that has teeth with flat tips to make a flat cut, so that the finger joints fit snugly.</p>
<p>I also made a new tool, or as they call it in woodworking, a jig. I made a crosscut sled for my table saw, and that was very useful in making the 232 cuts for the finger joints on this box. That required some patience since you have to set things up correctly, make sure the sides are properly aligned, and not make adjustments until you&rsquo;ve made all the cuts. I used some scraps to make a few joints, and messed that up a bit, but that led to this working out fine. Although at one point I dropped one of the sides and broke a couple of the end finger joints on it. I made sure they were on the back when I put it all together. 😉</p>
<p><img src="http://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2019/de49815b3c.jpg" alt="Finger joint detail"></p>
<p>Jenni picked the interior color. The paint company called it Salmon. I constructed the whole box before applying paint, so that step was a little awkward, but it turned out alright. Lesson learned, <em>I think</em>.  We decided to keep the plywood edges showing, so I ended up finishing those, and the exterior, with some clear satin polyurethane. Oh, the material was baltic birch plywood, which as you can see has a lot of layers.</p>
<p>Many parts of this were great learning experiences. Not all joints came out equally well but they were acceptable. Making the crosscut sled took longer than making this box but it was totally worth it. I&rsquo;d been wanting to make one for a while and I look forward to using it for many projects to come.</p>
