				"content_text": "About a week ago we were at the beginning of a \"historic\" winter storm. It had waves of various kinds of precipitation. Snow, sleet, ice, freezing rain, rain.\n\nAt the end of it there was the thickest layers of ice on everything that I'd ever seen in these parts.\n\n[![](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/de1b0dab31.jpg)](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/de1b0dab31.jpg)\n\n[![](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/26d46b952e.jpg)](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/26d46b952e.jpg)\n\n[![](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/f7384e9c31.jpg)](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/f7384e9c31.jpg)\n\n[![](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/dd45b0aeee.jpg)](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/dd45b0aeee.jpg)\n\nWe lost power on Sunday night at 7pm. Thankfully, it was restored on Monday at 1:30pm. At one point we emptied the fridge of perishables and placed them in a cooler outside. At least there was plenty of ice around to keep things cold 😄.

Mostly out of technological curiosity, and sure, a little bit out of a need for convenience. We didn&rsquo;t even have a doorbell, so people visiting or leaving packages would simply knock on the door which was easy to miss.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the prominent products made by large tech companies constantly stream video data from a doorbell to their servers for analysis and trade. That wasn&rsquo;t something I wanted.  So I was on the lookout for a product that would keep the video data local to my home network. It would still send data over the internet to my device if I wanted to access it, or respond to a doorbell ring, but it wouldn&rsquo;t be sending significant amounts of data that is of no value to me but has value to the surveillance industry.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, I have a bit of knowledge on tech stuff, so I can setup and manage a home network. I have wired ethernet cables in my house, and have slowly upgraded my network to use more advanced networking equipment made by Ubiquiti, rather than the stock WiFi enabled router provided by my ISP. It was with this in mind that I learned the Ubiquiti had recently launched a video doorbell in their UniFi line, which is what I use for my home networking equipment. Once I got a chance to place an order, I did, and sure enough the doorbell arrived a few days later. That was the easy part.</p>\n<p>Now, as I mentioned, we didn&rsquo;t have a doorbell, so we didn&rsquo;t even have wiring for it. I did some research, and figured out how I wanted to wire it. It&rsquo;s a low voltage circuit that requires a step-down AC transformer. Normally that is attached to the wiring directly at a box in an inaccessible area, but I found a solution where I could access a wall outlet and so wouldn&rsquo;t need to drill into a wall or floor. A friend had a plug-in transformer that he wasn&rsquo;t using, so all I needed was some wire, which I ordered. I also ordered a mechanical chime that would ring when the doorbell was pressed. I drew this rough sketch of how I imagined it getting wired.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/434d226695.jpg\"><img src=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/434d226695.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>At this point I set up a circuit on my desk and wired everything up. First it was just the doorbell which was easy to start and setup. Then I wired in the chime and tested that everything worked fine, which it did 🎉</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/cf13bb3d05.jpg\"><img src=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/cf13bb3d05.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>I was able to use an existing wire path for part of the way from the outlet to the door, so I got going by pulling wire through that. I drilled a hole next to the door, ran the wire through and installed the doorbell. Once again I tested that it was working fine. Next I installed the chime on the wall above the door on the inside and connected it to the circuit. And that was it for the wiring. Everything worked well. The doorbell had a good signal. This is what it looked like.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/9fbf77ec30.jpg\"><img src=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/9fbf77ec30.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>Now all I had to do was to clean up and conceal the wiring. I didn&rsquo;t have anything for this so I researched some more and ordered some cable concealing strips. Once those arrived I set about cutting pieces to length and enclosed much of the wire by the door with it. I also hid some of the wiring in the moulding along which I had run it. That was handy and probably cut my concealing cost in half.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/afea39f4f5.jpg\"><img src=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/afea39f4f5.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>So far the experience has been nice. There&rsquo;s still issues with the integration of the app. The notification always fires when the doorbell rings, but live video and audio can be cut off some times.

				"content_html": "<p>I’ve been using a <a href=\"https://www.owcdigital.com/products/thunderbay-4\">OWC Thunderbay 4 (Thunderbolt 2)</a> external enclosure with four 3 TB hard disk drives for the last two years. I bought it on eBay as a new but opened product. It’s been great. I had two of the drives in a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_RAID_levels#RAID_0\">RAID 0</a> configuration (for higher bandwidth single volume) and they were serving as the primary storage of about 1 TB of photos.</p>\n<p>Recently I decided to partially upgrade that setup by purchasing a Crucial 2 TB SSD. In order to install it I also had to purchase a <a href=\"https://eshop.macsales.com/item/OWC/MEQX3TRAY/\">OWC Spare Drive Tray</a> since the ones in my Thunderbay didn’t have the right setup for 2.5” drives. That took a few days to arrive. In the meantime I installed the SSD into an old USB LaCie enclosure and moved my files over to it.</p>\n<p>I decided to measure the drive performance as I went through this process. And for that I used <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blackmagic-disk-speed-test/id425264550?mt=12\">Blackmagic Disk Speed Test</a> which is available for free on the Mac App Store.</p>\n<p>Each disk in my original setup had about 190 MB/s read/write speed.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/555d71e507.jpg\" alt=\"Individual hard disk performance in Thunderbay 4.\"></p>\n<p>The RAID 0 gave me about 300-320 MB/s. I forgot to speed test it before I removed it, but that’s what I recall from back when I first set it up.</p>\n<p>In the intermediate setup with the LaCie enclosure I got about 250 MB/s write and 270 MB/s read speed.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/db8b2160a7.jpg\" alt=\"SSD inside LaCie enclosure.\"></p>\n<p>Once the drive tray arrived, I moved the SSD over to that and into the Thunderbay for the final setup where I’m now getting about 350 MB/s write and about 380 MB/s read speed.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/7d7e7f5628.jpg\" alt=\"SSD in Thunderbay.\"></p>\n<p>I may be able to extract some more performance from this SSD by making some other purchases and changes, but I don’t feel compelled to do that at this time. This is better than what I had, and quite acceptable for my use. In fact I felt totally comfortable moving my iCloud Photo library over to it as well. This freed up about a third of my internal drive storage.</p>\n<p>I could’ve done this sooner but the tradeoff of storage size vs. price didn’t seem worth it. In the future I may keep an eye on the price of such drives and pick up at sale to upgrade more of my Thunderbay drives.</p>\n<p>And in the foolhardy-comparison-department, here’s the crazy fast speed on the internal SSD on my iMac (Retina 5K, 27”, 2017 model).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/ffcbf83823.jpg\" alt=\"iMac internal SSD.\"></p>\n",

In the meantime I installed the SSD into an old USB LaCie enclosure and moved my files over to it.\n\nI decided to measure the drive performance as I went through this process. And for that I used [Blackmagic Disk Speed Test](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blackmagic-disk-speed-test/id425264550?mt=12) which is available for free on the Mac App Store.\n\nEach disk in my original setup had about 190 MB/s read/write speed.\n\n![Individual hard disk performance in Thunderbay 4.](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/555d71e507.jpg)\n\nThe RAID 0 gave me about 300-320 MB/s. I forgot to speed test it before I removed it, but that’s what I recall from back when I first set it up.\n\nIn the intermediate setup with the LaCie enclosure I got about 250 MB/s write and 270 MB/s read speed.\n\n![SSD inside LaCie enclosure.](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/db8b2160a7.jpg)\n\nOnce the drive tray arrived, I moved the SSD over to that and into the Thunderbay for the final setup where I’m now getting about 350 MB/s write and about 380 MB/s read speed.\n\n![SSD in Thunderbay.](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/7d7e7f5628.jpg)\n\nI may be able to extract some more performance from this SSD by making some other purchases and changes, but I don’t feel compelled to do that at this time. This is better than what I had, and quite acceptable for my use. In fact I felt totally comfortable moving my iCloud Photo library over to it as well. This freed up about a third of my internal drive storage.\n\nI could’ve done this sooner but the tradeoff of storage size vs. price didn’t seem worth it. In the future I may keep an eye on the price of such drives and pick up at sale to upgrade more of my Thunderbay drives.\n\nAnd in the foolhardy-comparison-department, here’s the crazy fast speed on the internal SSD on my iMac (Retina 5K, 27”, 2017 model).\n\n![iMac internal SSD.](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/ffcbf83823.jpg) \n",

				"content_html": "<p>I&rsquo;ve been journaling in <a href=\"https://dayoneapp.com\">Day One</a> for some time now. I like it for a lot of reasons, and it&rsquo;s working out great. So far I&rsquo;ve been using it as a plain old journal, where you write what&rsquo;s on your mind. Recently, I decided that I wanted to get my digital history into it as well. One of the first things that came to mind was my <a href=\"https://foursquare.com\">Foursquare/Swarm</a> checkin history which goes back to 2009. I decided to start there.</p>\n<p>I exported all my data and wrote a script in Python to extract what I needed from it to make journal entries. The two relevant files were <code>checkins.json</code> and <code>photos.json</code>. You can <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/samgrover/26939e0b68a26b7fe03a7a4bd37bdcf6\">get my script on Github by selecting here</a> if you&rsquo;d like to use it, or dig into it. It should also appear embedded at the end of this post. First the script pre-processes the data to get all the photos attached to checkins. Then it goes over the checkin history to extract most of what I want, but since the exported data doesn&rsquo;t include venue coordinates, it has to do a little more.</p>\n<p>It makes calls to the <a href=\"https://developer.foursquare.com/docs\">Foursquare API</a> to fetch the venue coordinates for each checkin. Then it puts everything together and makes the actual entry using Day One&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dayoneapp.com/support/CLI\">command line utility</a>. I had several thousand entries but the free plan for the API has a daily limit of 500 calls, so I manually ran it a few times over the course of a couple of weeks until they&rsquo;d all been imported. I could&rsquo;ve automated that but I wasn&rsquo;t keen on spending the time on that.</p>\n<p>Day One does allow one to link it to <a href=\"https://help.dayoneapp.com/tips-and-tutorials/using-ifttt-with-day-one\">IFTTT</a> so that all <em>new</em> checkins get logged automatically, and I enabled that a while back, but I&rsquo;ve not been happy with that integration. Now that I&rsquo;m familiar with the flow of data, I plan to create new entries every couple of months or so, perhaps with a new script that works entirely with the API.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;d love to hear if you have automated any journaling as I&rsquo;m keen to explore other ways of doing so myself.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",

Then it goes over the checkin history to extract most of what I want, but since the exported data doesn't include venue coordinates, it has to do a little more.\n\nIt makes calls to the [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs) to fetch the venue coordinates for each checkin. Then it puts everything together and makes the actual entry using Day One's [command line utility](http://dayoneapp.com/support/CLI). I had several thousand entries but the free plan for the API has a daily limit of 500 calls, so I manually ran it a few times over the course of a couple of weeks until they'd all been imported. I could've automated that but I wasn't keen on spending the time on that.\n\nDay One does allow one to link it to [IFTTT](https://help.dayoneapp.com/tips-and-tutorials/using-ifttt-with-day-one) so that all _new_ checkins get logged automatically, and I enabled that a while back, but I've not been happy with that integration. Now that I'm familiar with the flow of data, I plan to create new entries every couple of months or so, perhaps with a new script that works entirely with the API.\n\nI'd love to hear if you have automated any journaling as I'm keen to explore other ways of doing so myself.\n\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/samgrover/26939e0b68a26b7fe03a7a4bd37bdcf6.js\"></script>\n",
