				"title": "Importing Foursquare/Swarm history into Day One",
				"content_html": "<p>I&rsquo;ve been journaling in <a href=\"https://dayoneapp.com\">Day One</a> for some time now. I like it for a lot of reasons, and it&rsquo;s working out great. So far I&rsquo;ve been using it as a plain old journal, where you write what&rsquo;s on your mind. Recently, I decided that I wanted to get my digital history into it as well. One of the first things that came to mind was my <a href=\"https://foursquare.com\">Foursquare/Swarm</a> checkin history which goes back to 2009. I decided to start there.</p>\n\n<p>I exported all my data and wrote a script in Python to extract what I needed from it to make journal entries. The two relevant files were <code>checkins.json</code> and <code>photos.json</code>. You can <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/samgrover/26939e0b68a26b7fe03a7a4bd37bdcf6\">get my script on Github by selecting here</a> if you&rsquo;d like to use it, or dig into it. It should also appear embedded at the end of this post. First the script pre-processes the data to get all the photos attached to checkins. Then it goes over the checkin history to extract most of what I want, but since the exported data doesn&rsquo;t include venue coordinates, it has to do a little more.</p>\n\n<p>It makes calls to the <a href=\"https://developer.foursquare.com/docs\">Foursquare API</a> to fetch the venue coordinates for each checkin. Then it puts everything together and makes the actual entry using Day One&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dayoneapp.com/support/CLI\">command line utility</a>. I had several thousand entries but the free plan for the API has a daily limit of 500 calls, so I manually ran it a few times over the course of a couple of weeks until they&rsquo;d all been imported.

				"content_text": "I've been journaling in [Day One](https://dayoneapp.com) for some time now. I like it for a lot of reasons, and it's working out great. So far I've been using it as a plain old journal, where you write what's on your mind. Recently, I decided that I wanted to get my digital history into it as well. One of the first things that came to mind was my [Foursquare/Swarm](https://foursquare.com) checkin history which goes back to 2009. I decided to start there.\n\nI exported all my data and wrote a script in Python to extract what I needed from it to make journal entries. The two relevant files were `checkins.json` and `photos.json`. You can [get my script on Github by selecting here](https://gist.github.com/samgrover/26939e0b68a26b7fe03a7a4bd37bdcf6) if you'd like to use it, or dig into it. It should also appear embedded at the end of this post. First the script pre-processes the data to get all the photos attached to checkins. Then it goes over the checkin history to extract most of what I want, but since the exported data doesn't include venue coordinates, it has to do a little more.\n\nIt makes calls to the [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs) to fetch the venue coordinates for each checkin. Then it puts everything together and makes the actual entry using Day One's [command line utility](http://dayoneapp.com/support/CLI). I had several thousand entries but the free plan for the API has a daily limit of 500 calls, so I manually ran it a few times over the course of a couple of weeks until they'd all been imported.

				"content_html": "<p><img src=\"http://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2019/c68e70e792.jpg\" alt=\"Tabletop shelf/box\" /></p>\n\n<p>Jenni wanted a shelf in the kitchen to organize things a little better and I wanted to make different kinds of boxes. That&rsquo;s how this came to be.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m a beginner woodworker and always on the lookout for new projects that I can use as an excuse to learn new skills, and let&rsquo;s be honest, to buy new tools. For this project I ended up buying a new blade for my table saw. One that has teeth with flat tips to make a flat cut, so that the finger joints fit snugly. You can find the one I bought <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Yq7jnV\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I also made a new tool, or as they call it in woodworking, a jig. I made a crosscut sled for my table saw, and that was very useful in making the 232 cuts for the finger joints on this box. That required some patience since you have to set things up correctly, make sure the sides are properly aligned, and not make adjustments until you&rsquo;ve made all the cuts. I used some scraps to make a few joints, and messed that up a bit, but that led to this working out fine. Although at one point I dropped one of the sides and broke a couple of the end finger joints on it.

That's how this came to be.\n\nI'm a beginner woodworker and always on the lookout for new projects that I can use as an excuse to learn new skills, and let's be honest, to buy new tools. For this project I ended up buying a new blade for my table saw. One that has teeth with flat tips to make a flat cut, so that the finger joints fit snugly. You can find the one I bought [here](https://amzn.to/2Yq7jnV).\n\nI also made a new tool, or as they call it in woodworking, a jig. I made a crosscut sled for my table saw, and that was very useful in making the 232 cuts for the finger joints on this box. That required some patience since you have to set things up correctly, make sure the sides are properly aligned, and not make adjustments until you've made all the cuts.
