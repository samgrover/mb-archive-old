Snow, sleet, ice, freezing rain, rain.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of it there was the thickest layers of ice on everything that I&rsquo;d ever seen in these parts.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/de1b0dab31.jpg\"><img src=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/de1b0dab31.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/26d46b952e.jpg\"><img src=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/26d46b952e.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/f7384e9c31.jpg\"><img src=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/f7384e9c31.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/dd45b0aeee.jpg\"><img src=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/dd45b0aeee.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>We lost power on Sunday night at 7pm. Thankfully, it was restored on Monday at 1:30pm. At one point we emptied the fridge of perishables and placed them in a cooler outside. At least there was plenty of ice around to keep things cold 😄.

Snow, sleet, ice, freezing rain, rain.\n\nAt the end of it there was the thickest layers of ice on everything that I'd ever seen in these parts.\n\n[![](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/de1b0dab31.jpg)](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/de1b0dab31.jpg)\n\n[![](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/26d46b952e.jpg)](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/26d46b952e.jpg)\n\n[![](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/f7384e9c31.jpg)](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/f7384e9c31.jpg)\n\n[![](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/dd45b0aeee.jpg)](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/dd45b0aeee.jpg)\n\nWe lost power on Sunday night at 7pm.

Mostly out of technological curiosity, and sure, a little bit out of a need for convenience. We didn&rsquo;t even have a doorbell, so people visiting or leaving packages would simply knock on the door which was easy to miss.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, the prominent products made by large tech companies constantly stream video data from a doorbell to their servers for analysis and trade. That wasn&rsquo;t something I wanted.  So I was on the lookout for a product that would keep the video data local to my home network. It would still send data over the internet to my device if I wanted to access it, or respond to a doorbell ring, but it wouldn&rsquo;t be sending significant amounts of data that is of no value to me but has value to the surveillance industry.</p>\n\n<p>Thankfully, I have a bit of knowledge on tech stuff, so I can setup and manage a home network. I have wired ethernet cables in my house, and have slowly upgraded my network to use more advanced networking equipment made by Ubiquiti, rather than the stock WiFi enabled router provided by my ISP. It was with this in mind that I learned the Ubiquiti had recently launched a video doorbell in their UniFi line, which is what I use for my home networking equipment. Once I got a chance to place an order, I did, and sure enough the doorbell arrived a few days later. That was the easy part.</p>\n\n<p>Now, as I mentioned, we didn&rsquo;t have a doorbell, so we didn&rsquo;t even have wiring for it. I did some research, and figured out how I wanted to wire it. It&rsquo;s a low voltage circuit that requires a step-down AC transformer. Normally that is attached to the wiring directly at a box in an inaccessible area, but I found a solution where I could access a wall outlet and so wouldn&rsquo;t need to drill into a wall or floor. A friend had a plug-in transformer that he wasn&rsquo;t using, so all I needed was some wire, which I ordered. I also ordered a mechanical chime that would ring when the doorbell was pressed. I drew this rough sketch of how I imagined it getting wired.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/434d226695.jpg\"><img src=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/434d226695.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>At this point I set up a circuit on my desk and wired everything up. First it was just the doorbell which was easy to start and setup. Then I wired in the chime and tested that everything worked fine, which it did 🎉</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/cf13bb3d05.jpg\"><img src=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/cf13bb3d05.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I was able to use an existing wire path for part of the way from the outlet to the door, so I got going by pulling wire through that. I drilled a hole next to the door, ran the wire through and installed the doorbell. Once again I tested that it was working fine. Next I installed the chime on the wall above the door on the inside and connected it to the circuit. And that was it for the wiring. Everything worked well. The doorbell had a good signal. This is what it looked like.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/9fbf77ec30.jpg\"><img src=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/9fbf77ec30.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Now all I had to do was to clean up and conceal the wiring. I didn&rsquo;t have anything for this so I researched some more and ordered some cable concealing strips. Once those arrived I set about cutting pieces to length and enclosed much of the wire by the door with it. I also hid some of the wiring in the moulding along which I had run it. That was handy and probably cut my concealing cost in half.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/afea39f4f5.jpg\"><img src=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/afea39f4f5.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>So far the experience has been nice. There&rsquo;s still issues with the integration of the app. The notification always fires when the doorbell rings, but live video and audio can be cut off some times. These are software issues and I hope they get resolved soon. A new app update came out while I was writing this post and that greatly improved the performance of showing video right after launching the app. It&rsquo;s good to know they are making improvements like I had hoped.</p>\n\n<p>In these pandemic days it&rsquo;s mostly just package delivery people coming by and I&rsquo;ve noticed that only about half of them ring the doorbell. There have been no times when I&rsquo;ve needed to talk to someone. I&rsquo;m still dialing in the right motion triggers and sensitivity so I can minimize the false positives. Once that is the case I may even enable notifications for all motion events, if needed. There have been one or two cases when the delivery person delivered something on the porch and didn&rsquo;t trigger the motion sensing. Hopefully those will get ironed out. I can still see those because I&rsquo;ve set things up to record all video on a buffer that lasts several days. The interface for recorded video is great and makes it really easy to look at relevant events which get logged.</p>\n\n<p>Overall I&rsquo;m pretty happy with it.

I&rsquo;m working on an update that takes a fresh approach to the photo selection flow by utilizing new features coming in iOS 14.</p>\n\n<p>iOS 14 has a powerful new system provided photo picker that lets users pick photos from their library. The new picker has great features for browsing, searching, making multiple selections, etc. This is perfect for apps like Mimi where people can pick the photos they want to upload with minimum friction and with an experience that feels true to iOS. I&rsquo;m very conscious of privacy in apps, so it gives me great joy to note that with this new picker Mimi will no longer need to ask for Photos permission.</p>\n\n<p>I had planned to enhance the original photo selection screen with new features for better selection, but now I can utilize that time towards other features that folks have requested. Features that I think will be a lot more useful in the long term, like support for the share sheet, and drag and drop, that allows sending photos into Mimi from other apps. And I have more ideas that I hope to share after this initial set of work is complete.</p>\n\n<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to bring this new experience to you sometime after iOS 14 launches this Fall. I appreciate your support and comments. If you&rsquo;ve liked using Mimi, I&rsquo;d love it if you could <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mimi-uploader/id1484555696\">give it a rating or review on the App Store</a>.

Then came surgery, recovery, return of ability, and progression from there on. Yesterday I hiked up <a href=\"https://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/Dog_Mountain_Hike\">Dog Mountain</a>. It was the most strenuous hike I&rsquo;ve ever done. And as I sit here all sore the next day, I&rsquo;m incredibly grateful to be able to do that.</p>\n\n<p>Due to it&rsquo;s incredible popularity, and limited parking, the Forest Service has been issuing permits for weekend days. Jenni bought ours a while ago, and we have been making small preparations ever since. Purchasing some gear (<a href=\"https://www.rei.com/product/148595/rei-co-op-flash-22-print-pack\">backpack</a>, <a href=\"https://hydrapak.com/products/shape-shift-3-liter\">water reservoir</a>, hiking poles), and going on light to moderate hikes starting in early Spring. Although we didn&rsquo;t go on any hike for over a month before this, and that was a mistake.</p>\n\n<p>We arrived at the trailhead just before 9:30am, met up with our friends, and started the hike a few minutes later. About half a mile up is a &ldquo;difficulty fork&rdquo; 😂</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/41ab47c447.jpg\" alt=\"Group at difficulty fork\" /></p>\n\n<p>For the first 2.5 to 3 miles the trail is like many others in the Gorge, comprising of switchbacks through the woods.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/57ee4dfe13.jpg\" alt=\"Tree in the forest\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/fd6f11f750.jpg\" alt=\"Mossy, dreamy forest\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/2220be6561.jpg\" alt=\"Double trunks\" /></p>\n\n<p>Halfway to the top the trail emerged from the forest briefly for a sweeping vista of the river and the gorge.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/d77e20366b.jpg\" alt=\"Vista of river\" /></p>\n\n<p>For the last half mile going up, we were out of the trees and surrounded by wildflowers. It was here that the wind also picked up significantly. This final stretch afforded gorgeous view all the way, with our trail surrounded by steep slopes full of wildflowers.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/01d37e049d.jpg\" alt=\"Emerging into the clearance\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/7d2ee241f1.jpg\" alt=\"Wildflowers, with Wind Mountain in the distance\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/ab2824ee88.jpg\" alt=\"Trail through the slope of wildflowers\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/4fd95d3143.jpg\" alt=\"Wildflower photography on the edge\" /></p>\n\n<p>The views at the summit were incredible. Some fast moving clouds engulfed us soon after we arrived. That was quite a show before it cleared up in a few minutes. It was time to put on another layer. We sat there and enjoyed the views as we had lunch comprising of tasty sandwiches that Jenni had made, and some chips.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/7bf6619913.gif\" alt=\"Fast moving clouds at the summit\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/865a9e2f85.jpg\" alt=\"Jenni coming up the last switchback\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/631daf21e2.jpg\" alt=\"Lunch at the top\" /></p>\n\n<p>As we started back down, my IT band was hurting on the outer side of each of my knees. I was annoyed at myself for not having taken the time to go on hikes and do regular stretches since the <a href=\"https://samgrover.com/2019/04/30/hiking-at-coyote.html\">Coyote Wall hike</a> from over a month ago. Every downward step was painful. Soon Jenni reminded me of the cross-leg stretches and those helped. Those and the hiking poles were incredibly helpful in making the descent.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/fc8ebfc65d.jpg\" alt=\"Stretches on the trail. Photo by Jenni.\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/90ddff0bac.jpg\" alt=\"Heading back down\" /></p>\n\n<p>Heading back down we reentered the forest, and it sheltered us from the sun and wind for the rest of the way.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/a1ab443d81.jpg\" alt=\"Staggered view of the group\" /></p>\n\n<p>All in all this was a great hike with friends, and brought tremendous satisfaction on a personal level. It is entirely possible that someday my back may go bad again, but I&rsquo;m grateful that I can do this today, and motivated to keep it this way. I&rsquo;m also grateful for Jenni who has been supportive and encouraging all along the way ❤️</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"activity-stats\">Activity stats:</h3>\n\n<p>Distance: 7 miles (11.27 km)<br />\nElevation Gain: 2800 ft (853m)<br />\nAscent/Descent: 800 ft/mile (75.76 m/km)<br />\nTime (including breaks): 5h 30m</p>\n",

About half a mile up is a \"difficulty fork\" 😂\n\n![Group at difficulty fork](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/41ab47c447.jpg)\n\nFor the first 2.5 to 3 miles the trail is like many others in the Gorge, comprising of switchbacks through the woods.\n\n![Tree in the forest](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/57ee4dfe13.jpg)\n\n![Mossy, dreamy forest](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/fd6f11f750.jpg)\n\n![Double trunks](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/2220be6561.jpg)\n\nHalfway to the top the trail emerged from the forest briefly for a sweeping vista of the river and the gorge.\n\n![Vista of river](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/d77e20366b.jpg)\n\nFor the last half mile going up, we were out of the trees and surrounded by wildflowers. It was here that the wind also picked up significantly. This final stretch afforded gorgeous view all the way, with our trail surrounded by steep slopes full of wildflowers.\n\n![Emerging into the clearance](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/01d37e049d.jpg)\n\n![Wildflowers, with Wind Mountain in the distance](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/7d2ee241f1.jpg)\n\n![Trail through the slope of wildflowers](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/ab2824ee88.jpg)\n\n![Wildflower photography on the edge](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/4fd95d3143.jpg)\n\nThe views at the summit were incredible. Some fast moving clouds engulfed us soon after we arrived. That was quite a show before it cleared up in a few minutes. It was time to put on another layer. We sat there and enjoyed the views as we had lunch comprising of tasty sandwiches that Jenni had made, and some chips.\n\n![Fast moving clouds at the summit](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/7bf6619913.gif)\n\n![Jenni coming up the last switchback](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/865a9e2f85.jpg)\n\n![Lunch at the top](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/631daf21e2.jpg)\n\nAs we started back down, my IT band was hurting on the outer side of each of my knees. I was annoyed at myself for not having taken the time to go on hikes and do regular stretches since the [Coyote Wall hike](https://samgrover.com/2019/04/30/hiking-at-coyote.html) from over a month ago. Every downward step was painful. Soon Jenni reminded me of the cross-leg stretches and those helped. Those and the hiking poles were incredibly helpful in making the descent.\n\n![Stretches on the trail. Photo by Jenni.](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/fc8ebfc65d.jpg)\n\n![Heading back down](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/90ddff0bac.jpg)\n\nHeading back down we reentered the forest, and it sheltered us from the sun and wind for the rest of the way.\n\n![Staggered view of the group](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/a1ab443d81.jpg)\n\nAll in all this was a great hike with friends, and brought tremendous satisfaction on a personal level. It is entirely possible that someday my back may go bad again, but I'm grateful that I can do this today, and motivated to keep it this way. I'm also grateful for Jenni who has been supportive and encouraging all along the way ❤️\n\n### Activity stats:\nDistance: 7 miles (11.27 km)  \nElevation Gain: 2800 ft (853m)  \nAscent/Descent: 800 ft/mile (75.76 m/km)  \nTime (including breaks): 5h 30m  \n",

Jenni and I had never been to this hike before but our friends were familiar with it.</p>\n\n<p>There are multiple trails that meet each other at various points. Some are gentle slopes, while others are steeper.
